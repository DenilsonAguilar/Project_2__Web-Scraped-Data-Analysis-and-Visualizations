# Project_2__Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations

##Overview

###For this project I choose Wikipedia, I set up a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data itself.

###Answers will be given programmatically as output and at least two questions should have answers demonstrated via a plot.

###Seaborn will be used to plot my analysis. Mu plots should include data labels, and a title that summarizes my conclusion, and, styling should be applied.
