# Project_2__Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations

Overview

For this project I choose Wikipedia, I set up a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data itself.

Answers will be given programmatically as output and at least two questions should have answers demonstrated via a plot.

Seaborn will be used to plot my analysis. MY plots should include data labels, and a title that summarizes my conclusion, and, styling should be applied.

THE FINAL FILE IS CALLED : Final Project 2 File - Final Version
THE OTHER FILES SCRAP PAGES FROM PREVIOUS YEARS, THEY DO NOT CONTAIN THE SAME INFORMATION AS THE FINAL FILE WHICH IS BASED ON 2024 INFORMATION.
THE OTHER FILES ARE FROM THE 2020 - 2023 PAGES.
links for the pages they use:
- 2020: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_films_(2020)
- 2021: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_films_(2021)

- 2023: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_films_(2023)

The questions the file/files will be answering the questions listed below:
1. What are the most common genres for Netflix films?
2. What are the top 5 languages most commonly used in Netflix films?
3. How has the number of Netflix films released each month changed over time?
4. What are the top 5 Netflix films with the longest runtime?

There's An Addtional One At The End Included For The Fun Of It.
- Does language and genre have anything to do with films?

These are the links to the sites used in creation of the final project 2 file.

UPDATE: THE FILE ITSELF HAD TO BE RECREATE/REMADE DUE TO THE CHANGES THAT RECENTLY OCCURED TO THE SITE ITSELF, i am so tired, i won't make any more changes if they decide to change the wiki page again, the information my file is based as of the current time they were uploaded, it can change at anytime.

I Am Exhausted but I was able to fix a majority of the issues with the I ran with into the file itself, it took a while to fix the issues i was recieving, im going to rest now, my eyes burn from staying up.
